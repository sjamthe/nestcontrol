Basics:

.nestrc for auth details (it's gonna be plaintext somewhere, unfortunately)
Handle request failure by attempting to login again (especially important if used a cached token)
Make OO

Then the fun stuff begins:

Turn system on via schedule and set the setpoint
Shut system off when target temp is reached
Jabber client for control?
Web interface for control?
